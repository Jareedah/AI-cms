Keep in mind that if the customer has only one contact and you turned the email notifications for this contact, then no emails will be sent for any of the related features.<\/p>\n<p>Another example, let&#8217;s assume your customer has 5 contacts and all of them have access to projects, but you want only one contact to receive any projects related emails, in this case, you will give permission for projects for all 5 contacts, but only to the one contact you will turn on email notifications eq for project and task, in this case, this contact will only receive emails related to the projects and project tasks but not the remaining 4 contacts.<\/p>\n<p>The email notifications feature for contacts in Perfex CRM is also used to pre-select the contacts eq while sending an invoice\u00a0to a customer. If you navigate to Sales-&gt;Invoices-&gt;[Invoice] and click on the email icon to send the invoice to customer, the contacts that have enabled email notifications for invoice will be auto-selected in the select dropdown, keep in mind that if you select manually some contact that doesn&#8217;t have enabled email notification for invoices, the email will be sent to ALL selected contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Currently available email notifications for contacts are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invoice<\/li>\n<li>Credit Note<\/li>\n<li>Estimate<\/li>\n<li>Tickets<\/li>\n<li>Project<\/li>\n<li>Contract<\/li>\n<li>Task &#8211; Only for project related tasks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New Contact To create new customer contact, open the customer profile in the admin area that you want to create the contact then click on the tab Contacts.
