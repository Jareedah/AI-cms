The process for adding this code differs depending on what CMS system you are using, but full instructions (with screenshots) can be seen here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/help.attributer.io\/articles\/add-the-attributer-code-to-your-wordpress-website\/\">WordPress<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/help.attributer.io\/articles\/add-attributer-code-to-your-webflow-website\/\">Webflow<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/help.attributer.io\/articles\/add-attributer-code-to-your-squarespace-website\/\">Squarespace<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/help.attributer.io\/articles\/add-attributer-code-to-your-wix-website\/\">Wix<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/help.attributer.io\/add-code-to-website\/\">Other<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Add hidden fields to your forms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you need to do is add a series of hidden fields to your forms. This will give Attributer a place to write the UTM parameters and other lead source data into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attributer works with 50+ different form builders and the process is slightly different for all of them, but generally speaking, you just need to add 6x hidden fields to your forms and then give them a specific name and default value.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfGMdECp0Ztkkr16MSFmhfzytP7p9TrgYVV5jorfc5FDY7v8SuBZCCzDeBrxf-V9uQ6EMFHetea_QrXLhbnRlDVmMh2sRvNmJiMUsdd50QpsO75pYePZKzA9Ebnv5YxRa80hW5D?key=euCTjwvMJg1e7nMewOmmTDb9\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fields you need to add are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Field #1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Name = Channel<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Default Value = [channel]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Field #2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Name = Channel Drilldown 1<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Default Value = [channeldrilldown1]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Field #3<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Name = Channel Drilldown 2<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Default Value = [channeldrilldown2]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Field #4<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Name = Channel Drilldown 3<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Default Value = [channeldrilldown3]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Field #5<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Name = Landing Page<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Default Value = [landingpage]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Field #6<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Name = Landing Page Group<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Default Value = [landingpagegroup]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You ultimately want your form to look a bit like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXc7ZNVMhMk0u_CfbdAM6KkjXNAECIdRArmCM0dDx0ZjZadgB7nuILo23sqQM_GpRGtxZS5My1jRIRUpQCFb2axre0_yku8MB04t9OQ7Nz98-Y2lJa7bJRpZc_p5zrPyWxJ3N_yCFg?key=euCTjwvMJg1e7nMewOmmTDb9\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Send the data into Perfex CRM<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have added the Attributer code to your website and added the hidden fields to your forms, the UTM parameters and other attribution should be getting captured by your form tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check this by looking at the Submissions. They should look a bit like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXdjX1FGY0rKD2oIBh4HFCm6VE8zZ488Ik9EvQc1PoBqx3axK_sqVPYPRNiD530wIdS0cmgTn5Sj8cXtYnyO84Vxh8yiuEa2-OaA6onaajS8is8PuqD56PxM5ife2FtA-s0SpKQMWw?key=euCTjwvMJg1e7nMewOmmTDb9\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s the case, then the final step is to send the data from your form tool to Perfex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose you already have an integration set up (via Zapier or Perfex\u2019s email integration). In that case, you just need to update the field mappings to send the additional data captured by your form tool into Perfex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXc6oo9HU0XwpehFmYlqBt5Nnps9-zKU72D5SszaU5_l7_tWg7Nu14gQ0SaD7aLeotegnCbm9LQ2gUdEkX07i7zsXOCsbL90CyvZY29jgqFg6hDbUd8Ot_Gzy9hXux3GM6madAteDw?key=euCTjwvMJg1e7nMewOmmTDb9\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to use this data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have attribution data on each new lead coming into Perfex, let\u2019s look at different&nbsp; ways you can use this data to help grow your business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tailor your lead follow-up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have information about what channel the lead came from, what ad they clicked, and what pages they landed on, you can use it to send more targeted follow-up messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if we had a lead from Organic Search, their landing page was our homepage, and they submitted a demo form request, we could probably assume they were interested in Perfex and in a later stage of the buying cycle. As a result, the messaging in our emails should probably be focused on getting the demo set up, educating them on the features, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if we saw someone came from a Facebook Ad, landed on our blog post about \u201810 ways to grow your business\u2019 and became a lead by downloading our eBook on business growth, we could probably assume they are not familiar with Perfex or even looking for a CRM, so the messaging should be more focused on how using a CRM can help them grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Report on the channels driving leads, customers, and revenue<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have the data about where each lead came from in Perfex, you can run reports showing which channels, campaigns, etc are driving your leads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you could run a report that shows the number of leads you got by channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfgaKTLDLAYkMJ2gvynd3kBdb1dF9VaD0naKGFbxNoDj6d7hMBkNun6KtWB2u_0D0UmvOlkH8Udb8lMmHRxbs4hDOxlAF_T3ZpL8Ux3-I2gJcykBuF5HY9Vl6lcQnyvFBmF1Pr9Pg?key=euCTjwvMJg1e7nMewOmmTDb9\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This would allow you to see which channels (Paid Search, Paid Social, Organic Search, etc) are generating you the most leads (and subsequently where you should be focusing your efforts to get more).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Attributer is a tool that can pass marketing attribution data (like the fact a lead came from Paid Search, Organic Search, Paid Social, etc) into Perfex.
