below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:\/\/your-perfexcrm-installation.com\/forms\/wtl\/715d3e13cea500fc168faa4e3dcb8e24?<strong>with_logo=1<\/strong><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Direct link sharing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The forms can be shared directly to your customers without actually embedding the form on your website, this feature is useful for example if you want to include a link in emails, SMS etc&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order Perfex CRM can know that the form link is shared directly and not embedded into an iframe, you need to specify the URL query string, in this case, Perfex CRM will provide better styling to the form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:\/\/your-perfexcrm-installation.com\/forms\/wtl\/715d3e13cea500fc168faa4e3dcb8e24<strong>?with_logo=1&amp;styled=1<\/strong><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create Multi-Column Form Layouts in Web To Lead Form (available from v1.9.0)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the form fields will be added in a single column full width of the document if you want to customize the form and have the fields displayed in multiple columns we have added the ability to achieve this with custom classes applied to the field, <strong>you can add up to 12 columns in 1 row.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following example, we will create 2 fields in 2 columns and 1 row.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind that the columns won&#8217;t be applied
