output or HTML files, your tables may not load, you should switch to the core files for your tables and use the new filters feature. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deleting the my_ prefixed files or renaming them to something else should fix the table loading issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, those files are located in <strong>application\/views\/admin\/tables<\/strong>, to check all the <strong>my_<\/strong> prefixed files you are using, you can do this in <strong>Setup->Settings->System Info<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t customized your installation, no additional steps are needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exclude inactive customers from the customers table<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Before version 3.1.0, the customers table was excluding inactive customers by default, this is not the case in version 3.1.0, you can use the new filters feature to create a default filter that will exclude inactive customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Add advanced filters for customers Add advanced filters for tasks Add advanced filters for invoices Add advanced filters for estimates
