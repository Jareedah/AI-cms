Subscription payments is provided via Stripe, you will need to have active Stripe account in order to use this feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that the <strong>subscriptions feature is different from <a href=\"https:\/\/help.perfexcrm.com\/recurring-invoice\/\">recurring invoices<\/a>.<\/strong> The recurring invoices are used only to re-create the invoice on a specific date but with subscriptions, if the customer is subscribed to the subscription, he\/she will be auto-billed via Stripe and the invoice will be created.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configure Stripe subscriptions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You will need first to configure the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/help.perfexcrm.com\/stripe\/\"><strong>Stripe Checkout<\/strong><\/a><strong> payment gateway

below.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stripe Products<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t created your products and billing plans, <strong>you should create via the Stripe Dashboard<\/strong>, Perfex CRM will fetch the billing plans directly from Stripe and will display them while creating\/editing subscription.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is <strong>no option to add billing plans via Perfex CRM admin area<\/strong>, you should always add the billing plans via Stripe Dashboard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Subscription Statuses<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 8 subscription statuses in Perfex CRM, 5 are the default Stripe subscription statuses and one additional status is added <strong>Future<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You

&#8211; The additional Perfex CRM status Future means that the customer subscribed but the first billing date is in future, as an example if the customer subscribes on 2018-05-18 and you configured First Billing Date to be 2018-05-25, the subscription is active but the customer will be billed at the future date.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"st-alert st-alert- \">Perfex CRM subscriptions for Stripe do

Date<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first billing date field,&nbsp;leave blank to use the date when the customer is subscribed to the subscription. <strong>This field must be a future date<\/strong>, if you select a date and the date is passed but the customer is not yet subscribed, the date when the customer will subscribe will be used.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note that Stripe does not support the creation of subscriptions in past dates.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscription Name<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add subscription name, shown to the customer too, in most cases

customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Customer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select customer for this subscription.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Currency<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The currency will be auto-selected

class=\"wp-block-heading\">Canceling Subscription<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To get familiar with canceling the subscription, please read more the official Stripe documentation by clicking <a href=\"https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/subscriptions\/canceling-pausing#canceling\">here<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Canceling from the admin area<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to cancel subscription directly from the admin area, you can open the subscription and click on the cancel button, you will be able to see 2 options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Cancel<\/li><li>Cancel at the end of the billing period<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you click <strong>Cancel<\/strong>, the subscription <strong>will be canceled immediately<\/strong>, if you click <strong>Cancel at the end of billing period<\/strong>, the subscription will be canceled based on the end billing period and also, in this case, you can reactive the subscription, but if you cancel it immediately, there is no option to reactivate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cancelling from customers area.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary contact also can cancel the subscription via the customers area, the options are identical like in the admin area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Credit Card Token<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfex CRM will store the Stripe customer id in the database for future payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit card token is token provided by Stripe related to the credit card that subscribed to the subscription, <strong>Perfex CRM does not store the credit card number in the database<\/strong>, the credit card token and last 4 digits are fetched directly from Stripe servers via API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary contact can update the credit card anytime he\/she want by logging into the customers area and navigating from the top <strong>Profile menu -&gt; Credit Card.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes your customers need to change the card info that they have on record with your business, whether that\u2019s just to swap in a preferred card, or because the card issuer sent a replacement. Stripe takes care of&nbsp;updating expiring cards&nbsp;for you, and also attempts to update saved card details when a&nbsp;customer\u2019s physical card is replaced, but in rare cases,<strong> if Stripe is unable to update the card details automatically, the contact must update the credit card manually via the customers area.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img
