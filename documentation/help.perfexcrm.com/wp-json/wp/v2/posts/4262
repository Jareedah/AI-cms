The code will be placed as iframe and you can adjust the width and height directly to the code snippet provided by Perfex CRM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Styling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to style the color of the input fields to fit with your website you can create<strong> custom.css<\/strong> file in assets\/css and apply the necessary styles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example<strong> changing inputs border color:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>body.estimate-request-form input {\n   border-color:red;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Example <strong>changing submit button<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>background color:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>body.estimate-request-form #form_submit {\n   background:red;\n}\n\nbody.estimate-request-form #form_submit:hover,\nbody.estimate-request-form #form_submit:active {\n   background:green;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Redirect user to custom URL after submission<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Via FTP\/cPanel go to <b>application\/helpers\/<\/b> and create (if don&#8217;t exists) file <b>my_functions_helper.php<\/b> and add the following code snippet:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>hooks()-&gt;add_action('estimate_request_form_submitted','my_estimate_request_form_submitted_redirect_to_custom_url');\n\nfunction my_estimate_request_form_submitted_redirect_to_custom_url($data){\n    echo json_encode(array(\n      'success'=&gt;true,\n      'redirect_url'=&gt;'http:\/\/yourcustomurl.com'\n    ));\n    die;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to include the &lt;?<\/strong>php<strong> opening tag at the top of the file if it&#8217;s not already added.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Include logo in the form<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To include your company logo in the form, you can either share or embed the url with query string parameter as shown below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:&#47;&#47;your-perfexcrm-installation.com\/form-url?with_logo=1<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Direct link sharing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The forms can be shared directly to your customers without actually embedding the form on your website, this feature is useful for example if you want to include a link in emails, SMS etc&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order Perfex CRM can know that the form link is shared directly and not embedded into an iframe, you need to specify the URL query string, in this case, Perfex CRM will provide better styling to the form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:\/\/your-perfexcrm-installation.com\/form-url<strong>?with_logo=1&amp;styled=1<\/strong><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create multi-column form layouts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the form fields will be added in a single column full width of the document if you want to customize the form and have the fields displayed in multiple columns we have added the ability to achieve this with custom classes applied to the field, <strong>you can add up to 12 columns in 1 row.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following example, we will create 2 fields in 2 columns and 1 row.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep in mind that the columns won&#8217;t be applied in the form builder, only when the form is viewed by accessing the integration link or is in an iframe.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a quick example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final result:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\"
