										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perfex CRM offers you the ability to auto close inactive tickets for a certain time.</p>
<p>This option is located in <strong>Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;Cron Job-&gt;Tickets</strong>, you can enter time number of <strong>hours</strong> that must be passed from the<strong> last ticket reply</strong> in order the system to auto close the ticket.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the system will only auto close tickets with the following statuses: <strong>Answered</strong>, <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>any other custom statuses</strong> you add for tickets in<strong> Setup-&gt;Support-&gt;Ticket Statuses</strong></p>
<p>After the ticket is auto closed, the system will send an email to the customer informing that his ticket is closed, you can navigate to <strong>Setup-&gt;Email Templates</strong> and edit the email template with name <strong>&#8220;Auto Close Ticket&#8221;</strong> to format the contents to fit for your needs, you can even disable this template if you don&#8217;t want your customers to be informed when the ticket is auto closed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Embeddable ticket form in Perfex CRM is a predefined form for tickets <strong>added in version 1.8.0</strong> which you can add to your websites with an iframe and when a user submits the form the ticket will automatically open a ticket in the system. You can use this form eq for a way your customers to contact you or offer support via this form on multiple websites.</p>



<p><strong>Imagine you have 5 websites</strong>, you can embed the form in all 5 websites and in this case all the form submits will be created as a ticket in your Perfex&nbsp;CRM installation, in this case all your staff members/sales agents will be able to view the requests send and take appropriate actions in no time.&nbsp;<strong>If the email field in the ticket form already exists as a contact in Perfex&nbsp;CRM under specific customer, the system will auto add this ticket to this contact.</strong></p>



<p>You can even add <strong>custom fields</strong> in the form, in <strong>Setup-&gt;Custom Fields</strong> if you create a custom field that belongs to tickets, a new checkbox will be shown at the bottom Show on ticket form, tick this checkbox if you want this custom field to be shown on the ticket form.</p>



<p>The form URL can be found at <strong>Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;Support-&gt;Ticket Form.</strong></p>



<p>The system will automatically show you a sample iframe embeddable code which you can copy and paste in your website.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Redirect User to Custom URL After Form Submission</h4>



<p>Via FTP/cPanel go to <b>application/helpers/</b> and create (if don&#8217;t exists) file <b>my_functions_helper.php</b> and add the following code snippet:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted lang:default decode:true">add_action('ticket_form_submitted','my_ticket_form_submitted_redirect_to_custom_url');

function my_ticket_form_submitted_redirect_to_custom_url($data){
    echo json_encode(array(
      'success'=&gt;true,
      'redirect_url'=&gt;'http://yourcustomurl.com'
    ));
    die;
}</pre>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to include the &lt;?</strong>php<strong> opening tag at the top of the file if it&#8217;s not already added.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Styling</h4>



<p>If you need to style the color of the input fields to fit with your website you can create<strong> custom.css</strong> file in assets/css and apply the necessary styles.</p>



<p>Example<strong> changing inputs border color:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted lang:css decode:true">body.ticket_form input {
border-color:red;
}</pre>



<p>Example <strong>changing submit button</strong>&nbsp;<strong>background color:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted lang:default decode:true">body.ticket_form #form_submit {
background:red;
}

body.ticket_form #form_submit:hover,
body.ticket_form #form_submit:active {
background:green;
}</pre>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Passing department ID in URL (from v2.1.1)</h4>



<p>If you are using the ticket form to a multiple URL&#8217;s where on each URL you need to send the ticket to a different department without the user that is filling the form knowing this, you can pass parameter in the ticket form URL to achieve this.</p>



<p>For example, let&#8217;s assume you have 2 different departments <strong>Billing</strong> and <strong>Technical Questions </strong>and the ticket form is placed on different landing pages or sections on your website corresponding to the department and you want each time the user fills the form e.q. on <strong>Billing</strong> landing page or section the ticket to go straight into the Billing department without the user knowing this.</p>



<p><strong>The first step you need to make is to get the department ID in</strong> <strong>Setup-&gt;Support-&gt;Departments</strong>, on the table first column you will be able to see the department ID, for this example let&#8217;s assume that your Billing department has ID with number 1.</p>



<p>After you get the department ID, you should modify your ticket form URL to https://your-crm-installation.com/forms/ticket?<strong>department_id=1</strong></p>



<p>If you visit the URL you will be able to see that the department field is hidden but the Billing department will be pre-selected and the ticket will go straight to the Billing department.</p>



<p>You can repeat this step for an unlimited number of departments, you will only need to change the department ID parameter.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Add custom form HTML, Eq. logo</h4>



<p>In application/helpers create a file (if don&#8217;t exists) and add the following code:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted lang:default decode:true">hooks()->add_action('ticket_form_start','my_ticket_form_start');
function my_ticket_form_start(){
    echo '&lt;img src="https://yourwebsite.com/logo.jpg">';
}</pre>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to include the &lt;?</strong>php<strong> opening tag at the top of the file if it&#8217;s not already added.</strong></p>



<p>Keep in mind that you will need to change the logo URL.</p>



<p><strong>When placing the iframe snippet code there are few things you need to consider.</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>If the protocol of your Perfex CRM installation is HTTP then use a HTTP page inside the iframe.</li><li>If the protocol of your Perfex CRM installation is https than use an https page inside the iframe.</li><li>Summarized will be <strong>no SSL Perfex CRM installation will need to place the link in no SSL</strong> eq landing page and backward, SSL websites with SSL Perfex CRM&nbsp;installation and no SSL website with none SSL Perfex CRM installation. You can read more about this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/iframe-do-not-mix-http-and-https" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li></ol>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/setup-ticket-form/">Setup Ticket Form</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ticket priorities and ticket statuses are stored in the database, however, with Perfex CRM you have the ability to translate them based on their ID.</p>



<p><strong>Note that changing the name from the admin area won&#8217;t</strong> affect how will be shown to the customers/staff members, you will need to change/include it in the language file by creating your own custom_lang.php file. The names from the admin area are used for your own recognition.<br><br>Only statuses/priorities that don&#8217;t exist<strong> in the language files will be shown the same like they are in the database.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating ticket statuses</strong></h2>



<p>By default all the predefined system statuses will be included in the language files with the following keys:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>ticket_status_db_1 (Open)</li><li>ticket_status_db_2 (In Progress)</li><li>ticket_status_db_3 (Answered)</li><li>ticket_status_db_4 (On Hold)</li><li>ticket_status_db_5 (Closed)</li></ul>



<p>If we want to&nbsp;translate&nbsp;the ticket status <strong>Open, </strong>this status is with ID&nbsp;1 create your own <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/overwrite-translation-text/">custom_lang.php</a> file and add the following lang key:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$lang&#91;'ticket_status_db_1'] = 'My Open Ticket Status';</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating ticket priorities</strong></h2>



<p>By default all the predefined system priorities&nbsp;will be included in the language files with the following keys:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>ticket_priority_db_1 (Low)</li><li>ticket_priority_db_2&nbsp;(Medium)</li><li>ticket_priority_db_3&nbsp;(High)</li></ul>



<p>If we want to&nbsp;translate&nbsp;the ticket status <strong>Low, this priority&nbsp;is with ID&nbsp;1 create your own <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/overwrite-translation-text/">custom_lang.php</a> file and add the following lang key:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$lang&#91;'ticket_priority_db_1'] = 'Low Priority';</code></pre>



<p>If you add your own&nbsp;status/priority you can find id on the left side of the table the first column will be ID.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="768" height="459" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-ticket-status-id-768x459.png" alt="translating tickets" class="wp-image-559" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-ticket-status-id-768x459.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-ticket-status-id-768x459-300x179.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-ticket-status-id-768x459-60x36.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-ticket-status-id-768x459-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating new ticket status</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="768" height="324" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-2new-ticket-status-translate-768x324.png" alt="translating new ticket status" class="wp-image-560" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-2new-ticket-status-translate-768x324.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-2new-ticket-status-translate-768x324-300x127.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-2new-ticket-status-translate-768x324-60x25.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trans-2new-ticket-status-translate-768x324-150x63.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>On the screenshot, there is new ticket status created Work Done with ID 6.</p>


<p>If you don&#8217;t add this ticket status in your custom_lang.php by default will be shown as Work Done.</p>



<p>To translate the ticket status navigate to your <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/overwrite-translation-text/">custom_lang.php</a> file and add the following line:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$lang&#91;'ticket_priority_db_6'] = 'Work Done';</code></pre>



<p>You can see the language key is ending with the status ID (_6).</p>



<p>The same process is with the ticket priorities.</p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/translating-ticket-priorities-and-ticket-statuses/">Translating ticket priorities and ticket statuses</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>
