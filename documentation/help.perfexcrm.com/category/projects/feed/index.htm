										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NOTE: This feature is available starting from version 1.6.2</strong></h4>



<p>By default Perfex CRM ships with 5 predefined statuses, Not Started, In Progress, On Hold, Cancelled, Finished&nbsp;but you can inject new statuses with simple action hook to fit for your needs.</p>


<div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">The statuses <strong>Not Started</strong> and <strong>Finished </strong>are core statuses and should remain untouched in order everything to works well.</div>



<p>We assume that you have some basic knowledge of reading php code for this article but wont be that hard if you don&#8217;t have. You can just copy and paste the code and adjust the keys for your needs (see below keys explanation).</p>



<p>In this example you will add 1&nbsp;new project status&nbsp;with name <strong>Planning</strong></p>



<p>In <strong>application/helpers</strong> create file <strong>my_functions_helper.php</strong> and add the following code:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;?php

hooks()->add_filter('before_get_project_statuses','my_add_custom_project_status');

function my_add_custom_project_status($current_statuses){
    // Push new status to the current statuses
    $current_statuses[] = array(
           'id'=>50, // new status with id 50
           'color'=>'#989898',
           'name'=>'Planning',
           'order'=>10,
           'filter_default'=>true, // true or false
        );
    // Return the statuses
    return $current_statuses;
}</code></pre>


<div class="st-alert st-alert- ">The ID for each status must to be unique.</div>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>id</strong> &#8211; The id of the project status, its recommended to <strong>add higher id number</strong> to prevent overlapping the default system id&#8217;s for the project statuses. Eq now currently there is projects statuses with id 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and in a future if new default project statuses is added with an id 6 and you already have injected your own status with id 6 can cause issues. <strong>Its not recommended to change the ID after there is project that are using the status id.</strong></li><li><strong>color</strong> &#8211; Color for this status in hex format.</li><li><strong>name</strong> &#8211; The name of the status that will be displayed to users.</li><li><strong>order</strong> &#8211; The order of the status.</li><li><strong>filter_default</strong> &#8211; This option is used if you want to exclude the projects that are using this status by default to be included in the lists tables. Eq if this option is false when you access the projects lists area by default the projects that are using to this status wont be shown and you will neeed manually to use the filters to include in the table.</li></ul>



<p>After you adjust the code to fit for your needs save the file my_functions_helper.php and you will be able to see your new project status.</p>

<h4 class="modal-title wp-block-heading">Project Invoice Info</h4>



<p>There is 3 types of how the invoice items will be structure when invoicing the project.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Single Line &#8211; <strong>Not applied if project Billing Type is Task Hours</strong>
<ol>
<li><b>Item name:</b> Project name</li>
<li><b>Description:</b> All tasks + total logged time per task</li>
</ol>
</li><li>Task Per Item &#8211; All billable tasks per item &#8211;<strong>&nbsp;(Not applied if Billing type is Fixed Cost)</strong>
<ol>
<li><b>Item name:</b> Project name + Task name</li>
<li><b>Description:</b> Total logged time</li>
</ol>
</li><li>All timesheets individualy &#8211; Applied all billable timesheets from tasks &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>(Not applied if Billing type is Fixed Cost)</strong>
<ol>
<li><b>Item name:</b> Project name + Task name</li>
<li><b>Description:</b> Timesheet start time + end time + total logged time</li>
</ol>
</li></ol>



<p><strong>Tasks that&nbsp;will be billed</strong></p>



<p>With Perfex CRM you have the ability to chose what tasks to bill when invoicing project.</p>



<p>To see the tasks that&nbsp;will be billed click on&nbsp;<strong>See tasks that will be billed on this invoice</strong>, you can adjust per your requirements.</p>



<p>If task is note complete when you click See tasks that will be on this invoice on the right side you can see a message Not Complete. Another message is auto added there with red if the task dont have any timers but you want to bill the task. Check the image below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/invoicing-project-tasks.png" alt="invoicing project" class="wp-image-828" width="580" height="475" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/invoicing-project-tasks.png 614w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/invoicing-project-tasks-300x246.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/invoicing-project-tasks-60x49.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/invoicing-project-tasks-150x123.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong><div class="st-alert st-alert- ">Tasks with future start date cannot be billed.</div></strong></p>



<p>Actually they can if you check them. By default the tasks with future start date wont be checked which is logical.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Notes</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>All billed tasks will be marked as finished</strong> (If any tasks found not finished) &#8211; No notification sent to assigned staff members.</li><li><strong>After the task is billed you cannot start timers or bill the task again</strong>. If is required to bill&nbsp;again you need to re-create the task.</li><li>If customer have different currency set then default currency the project currency will be the currency of the customer.</li></ul>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/invoicing-project/">Invoicing Project</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>Project have logged total 3 hours and Rate per hours in project settings is set 40$ the calculation will go like this:</p>
<p><strong>40$ x 3 = Total 120$</strong></p>
<p><strong>Example billing type Task Hours</strong></p>
<p>The total per hour in this case is taken from the task <strong>Total Per Hour</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>Fix firefox bug</strong> &#8211; Total per hour is 25$</p>
<p><strong>Create new table in database</strong> &#8211; Total Per hour is 40$</p>
<p>Task 1 (<strong>Fix firefox bug</strong>) have logged 1 hour and Task 2 (<strong>Create new table in database</strong>) have logged 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>The calculation goes like this:</strong></p>
<p>25$ x 1 hours (Task 1 &#8211; <strong>Fix firefox bug</strong>)</p>
<p>40$ x 2 hours (Task 2 &#8211; <strong>Create new table in database</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Equal to 105$</strong></p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/finance-overview/">Finance Overview</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>
