<div>Perfex CRM is not responsible in what currency the payment gateway will bill, in most cases the payment gateway use their supported currencies and account currency. In the request, Perfex CRM is passing the currency but this not means that the gateway will do a conversion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You as administrator/invoice creator are responsible to make sure that you gave your customer the correct available gateways for the invoices. You must know in what currency your customer will pay so you can adjust the invoice.</div>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/payment-modes-not-shown-on-invoice/">Payment Modes Not Shown on Invoice</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Unable to get the size of the image</strong> is an error thrown if <strong>TCPDF</strong> can&#8217;t fetch the image when using an absolute path.</p>
<p>The problem starts showing after you add a custom absolute URL in <strong>Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;PDF</strong>, in this case, the TCPDF is trying to fetch the image with a cURL request but the request is unsuccessful, you can contact your hosting provider to make sure that your cURL extension is properly configured and it&#8217;s up to date, otherwise try to follow the steps below and add the relative path to your logo image.</p>
<p>Before start, the workaround for this problem makes sure that the URL you have added in <strong>Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;PDF</strong> for the custom pdf logo image is valid and the image exists if the problem still exists try to add a relative path like mentioned below.</p>
<p>Upload the image to the<strong> folder where Perfex CRM is installed</strong> for example <strong>mylogo.jpg</strong></p>
<p>Go to Setup -&gt; Settings -&gt; PDF -&gt; <strong>Custom PDF Company Logo URL</strong> and <strong>only</strong> add mylogo<strong>.jpg<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-613" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/custom-pdf-logo-image.png" alt="" width="825" height="88" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/custom-pdf-logo-image.png 825w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/custom-pdf-logo-image-300x32.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/custom-pdf-logo-image-768x82.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/custom-pdf-logo-image-60x6.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/custom-pdf-logo-image-150x16.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></strong></p>
<p>In this case, the relative path (crm_installation_path/mylogo.jpg) for the image will be used and the script will be able to fetch the image.</p>
<p><div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">The logo image must be in the folder where Perfex CRM is installed.</div></p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/tcpdf-error-image-unable-to-get-the-size-of-the-image/">TCPDF ERROR: [Image] Unable to Get the Size of the Image</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>
