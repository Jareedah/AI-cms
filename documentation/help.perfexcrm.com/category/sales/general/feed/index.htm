<li>Subscription Payment Failed</li>
</ol>
<p>You can check all available email template mentioned above in <strong>Setup-&gt;Email Templates</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Checking if the email is opened</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to configure anything, the feature is auto turned ON and will work out of the box while you use Perfex CRM.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume you sent an invoice to a contact and you want to see if the contact opened the email, in admin area open the invoice preview area and click on the envelope menu icon, there will be a list of all tracked emails sent with indicator does they are opened or not.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3604" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking.png" alt="" width="971" height="357" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking.png 971w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-300x110.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-768x282.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-60x22.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-150x55.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" /></p>
<p>Use same steps to see if the email is opened is applied for all other features.</p>
<h3>Tracked emails not updated</h3>
<p>There is one occasion when this feature may not work properly, depends on the settings the contact/user configure in his email client. There is nothing Perfex CRM can do about this, the tracked email status will remain as <b>&#8220;<strong>Not Opened</strong>&#8220;</b></p>
<p>If the contact/user have an option in his email client/email interface to <strong>turn off remote content for the received emails, this may not work properly</strong>. Below you can find an example how this may look eq in <strong>Thunderbird</strong> email client</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3605" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-1024x80.png" alt="" width="980" height="77" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-1024x80.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-300x24.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-768x60.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-60x5.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-150x12.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy.png 1311w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>In this case, if contact just read the email and don&#8217;t turn on remote content or don&#8217;t allow remote content for this specific email, the email will remain as &#8220;<strong>Not Opened</strong>&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/version-2-0/">version 2.0.0</a> in Perfex CRM, there is a new major feature added that will help you to bill your customers in a more faster way based on subscription billing. Subscription payments is provided via Stripe, you will need to have active Stripe account in order to use this feature.</p>



<p>Please note that the <strong>subscriptions feature is different from <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/recurring-invoice/">recurring invoices</a>.</strong> The recurring invoices are used only to re-create the invoice on a specific date but with subscriptions, if the customer is subscribed to the subscription, he/she will be auto-billed via Stripe and the invoice will be created.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Subscription Statuses</h3>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-1024x640.png" alt="Perfex CRM Subscription Subscribe" class="wp-image-3569" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-1024x640.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-300x187.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-768x480.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-60x37.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-150x94.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Canceling Subscription</h3>



<p>To get familiar with canceling the subscription, please read more the official Stripe documentation by clicking <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/canceling-pausing#canceling">here</a></p>



<p><strong>Canceling from the admin area</strong></p>



<p>If you want to cancel subscription directly from the admin area, you can open the subscription and click on the cancel button, you will be able to see 2 options:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Cancel</li><li>Cancel at the end of the billing period</li></ul>



<p>If you click <strong>Cancel</strong>, the subscription <strong>will be canceled immediately</strong>, if you click <strong>Cancel at the end of billing period</strong>, the subscription will be canceled based on the end billing period and also, in this case, you can reactive the subscription, but if you cancel it immediately, there is no option to reactivate.</p>



<p><strong>Cancelling from customers area.</strong></p>



<p>The primary contact also can cancel the subscription via the customers area, the options are identical like in the admin area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Credit Card Token</h3>



<p>Perfex CRM will store the Stripe customer id in the database for future payments.</p>



<p>Credit card token is token provided by Stripe related to the credit card that subscribed to the subscription, <strong>Perfex CRM does not store the credit card number in the database</strong>, the credit card token and last 4 digits are fetched directly from Stripe servers via API.</p>



<p>The primary contact can update the credit card anytime he/she want by logging into the customers area and navigating from the top <strong>Profile menu -&gt; Credit Card.</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes your customers need to change the card info that they have on record with your business, whether that’s just to swap in a preferred card, or because the card issuer sent a replacement. Stripe takes care of&nbsp;updating expiring cards&nbsp;for you, and also attempts to update saved card details when a&nbsp;customer’s physical card is replaced, but in rare cases,<strong> if Stripe is unable to update the card details automatically, the contact must update the credit card manually via the customers area.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="356" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-1024x356.png" alt="Perfex CRM Update Stripe Card Token" class="wp-image-3570" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-1024x356.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-300x104.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-768x267.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-60x21.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-150x52.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token.png 1209w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Reusing the credit card token</strong></p>



<p><strong>The credit card token for this customer will be used or future subscription too</strong>, as example once the customer subscribe to the subscription, in Stripe, Perfex CRM will create customer and this credit card token will be linked to this customer, also the customer id from Stripe will be stored in Perfex CRM database for future payments.</p>



<p><strong>The next time you create a subscription for this customer, the customer won&#8217;t need to enter his credit card details again, he/she can just click a button and will be subscribed in no time.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="314" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1-1024x314.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3574" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1-1024x314.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1-300x92.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1-768x235.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1-60x18.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1-150x46.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-subscription-subscribe-via-token-1.png 1181w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing Subscriptions</h3>



<p>If you want to test the subscriptions, you need to <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/stripe/">configure</a> Stripe testing keys and read the following guide:<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/testing"> https://stripe.com/docs/testing</a></p>



<p>In this guide, you can get familiar with how the testing works and also there is a list of test credit cards.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>before switching to production mode</strong>, while testing, if you subscribed to any test subscription, <strong>make sure to delete those subscriptions from</strong> Perfex CRM admin area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="webhook">Configure Stripe checkout webhook for subscriptions (applicable for Perfex CRM versions below 2.4.0)</h3>



<p>While you are in Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;Payment Gateways-&gt;Stripe Checkout, <strong>you will need to configure the webhook for Stripe Subscriptions.</strong></p>



<p>Each installation will have unique webhook protection key, you will able to see yours in the&nbsp;<strong>Stripe Checkout Webhook Key </strong>field</p>



<p>In Stripe Dashboard navigate to <strong>Developers-&gt;Web hooks</strong>&nbsp;and click add a new endpoint.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="469" height="386" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3567" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point.png 469w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point-300x247.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point-60x49.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point-150x123.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /></figure>



<p>The webhook URL will be like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://your-crm-installation.com/gateways/stripe/webhook/[WEBHOOK_KEY]
</div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="777" height="135" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3566" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key.png 777w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-300x52.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-768x133.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-60x10.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-150x26.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></figure>



<p>Replace<strong>&nbsp;[WEBHOOK_KEY]</strong> with your actual webhook key.</p>



<p>Perfex CRM will generate a unique key for each installation, you can either use this key or manually add any key in <strong>alphanumeric</strong> you want,<strong> in case you decide to change the webhook key and you already have configured the webhook in Stripe, you will need to update the webhook key in Stripe dashboard too.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Test your webhook</strong></p>


<div class="st-alert st-alert- "><strong>It&#8217;s very important to make sure that your webhook is configured properly</strong>, otherwise, the subscription feature may not work properly.</div>



<p>Once you configure the webhook via Stripe dashboard, click on the configured webhook URL and click on the top right button <strong>Send test webhook </strong>then a popup modal will be shown, just click on the bottom right button Send test webhook</p>



<p>Keep in mind that the &#8220;<strong>Send test webhook&#8221; button is only available when you have toggled to view test data</strong>, once you test the webhook URL while test data is toggled on, switch off test data and <strong>configure the same webhook URL in your live account.</strong></p>

<p><div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">After the item is linked to transaction eq. invoice/estimate/proposal changing the item information won&#8217;t affect currently created transactions.</div></p>
<h4>Linking item into transaction</h4>
<p>This is very specific example that will show you how to link an item to invoice with all the fields explained.</p>
<p>Navigate to Sales-&gt;Invoices and click on the top left button <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/create-invoice/">create new invoice</a> and fill all the necessary information for this invoice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-933" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item-1024x131.png" alt="New Invoice Item" width="980" height="125" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item-1024x131.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item-300x38.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item-768x98.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item-60x8.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item-150x19.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-invoice-item.png 1655w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>On the top left Add item dropdown you can select your predefined items that will be auto inserted into the preview item area without you needing to fill all the necessary item information manually.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-934" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained-1024x362.png" alt="New Item Explained" width="980" height="346" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained-1024x362.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained-300x106.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained-768x272.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained-60x21.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained-150x53.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/new-item-explained.png 1646w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<h4><strong>Items Rates Based On Currency Usage (v.1.9.2)</strong></h4>
<p>In previous versions, the item had a field for a rate which you was using as general rate eq for your base <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/currencies/">currency</a>, but the problem was that in case customer has different currency than the base currency the rate won’t be accurate when selecting the item from the drop-down when creating invoice/estimate/proposal.</p>
<p>Perfex CRM can bill in your base currency or in the customer currency if configured in the customer profile.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that your base currency is USD and you have a customer which is using EUR currency when you created the item you has added the rate as in your base currency  (USD).</p>
<p>When you navigate to Sales-&gt;Items and try to create/edit item you will be able to see that new field for rate in EUR will be shown, in this case when you create invoice/estimate/proposal and select a customer that is using EUR currency and then select an item the EUR rate will be auto-populated in the preview area for the item before you add it to the table. This will help you to add the item&#8217;s rate only once and then re-use it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2018 aligncenter" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency.png" alt="" width="648" height="757" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency.png 648w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency-257x300.png 257w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency-51x60.png 51w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency-128x150.png 128w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that the rate for other currency will be shown only if customers have configured to use another currency than the base currency.</strong></p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/add-items-products/">Add Items/Products</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are using total to words in your transactions you need to add the currency words manually into the translation.</p>



<p>Perfex comes with 2 predefined currency names who are already added into the converter. If you added your own currency you need to add this also to&nbsp;total to words converter.</p>



<p>You need to add your currency database name and the currency string who will be output inside the invoice/estimate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="745" height="184" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/total-to-word-invoice-currency.png" alt="" class="wp-image-207" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/total-to-word-invoice-currency.png 745w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/total-to-word-invoice-currency-300x74.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/total-to-word-invoice-currency-60x15.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/total-to-word-invoice-currency-150x37.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></figure>



<p>In this example we will add British Pound to the converter.</p>



<p>Create a file with name <a href="https://www.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/my_functions_helper.zip"><strong>my_functions_helper.php</strong></a> in application/helpers/ and add the following code:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function add_total_to_words_currency($currencies){
    $currencies['GBP'] = 'British Pounds';

    return $currencies;
}

hooks()->add_filter('before_number_format_render_languge_currencies','add_total_to_words_currency');
</pre>



<p>Note that the GBP is the same as the name we have set up inside the CRM (showed in the image);</p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/add-currencies-in-total-to-words-feature/">Add currencies in total to words feature</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>
