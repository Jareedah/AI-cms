										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The estimate request feature is added in Perfex CRM version 2.8.0 and it&#8217;s used to <strong>create forms that your customers or potential customers can use to request an estimation of cost</strong> for services or products from your company, the estimates request feature give you the ability to add various types of fields that can be tailored for your company requirements.</p>



<p>For example, if your company is offering website design, your customers can request an estimate request for a website design via the form that you have previously created in Perfex CRM. Usually, the forms will have more general questions like &#8220;What is your budget&#8221;, &#8220;Urgency&#8221;, &#8220;Type of website&#8221; etc&#8230; and based on the information the customer entered in the form, you can create an <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/category/sales/estimates/">estimate </a>in Perfex CRM and send to the customer.</p>



<p>The forms can be sent directly to the customer as direct link or you can embed the form via iframe directly in your existing website pages e.q. you can have a menu link on your existing company website named &#8220;Request estimate&#8221; and in this page, you can embed the form iframe.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create estimate request forms</h2>



<p>The first step is to create an estimate request form, in Perfex CRM you can create unlimited number of estimate request forms, to achieve this, when logged-in as admin user follow the steps below.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Click <strong>Setup </strong>then <strong>Estimate request-&gt;Forms</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>New Form</strong>.</li><li>Add <strong>form name</strong>, for personal identification e.q. &#8220;Website estimate request&#8221;.</li><li><strong>Language</strong>&nbsp;– The language is currently used only for the validation messages.</li><li><strong>Submit button text</strong>&nbsp;– The bottom where the user will need to click to submit the form E.q. Request a Quote or Contact us, feel free to adjust to fit your needs.</li><li><strong>Message to show after the form is successfully submitted</strong>&nbsp;– This message will be shown after use successfully submit the form.</li><li><strong>Status</strong>&nbsp;– The estimate request will need to be in status after successfully is submitted into the Perfex CRM database.</li><li><strong>Responsible</strong>&nbsp;– Auto-assign the estimate request to a specific staff member.</li><li><strong>Notification settings</strong>&nbsp;– All users based on the notification type will be notified via built-in notification inside Perfex CRM and additionally, the responsible estimate request staff member will get an email notification if in Setup-&gt;Email Templates -&gt; Estimate Request Assigned (Sent to Staff) is not checked as disabled.</li><li><strong>Recaptcha</strong>&nbsp;– You can use Google Recaptcha&nbsp;to prevent spamming. The field for Google Recaptcha will be shown only if you have&nbsp;<a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/add-google-recaptcha/">previously configured the recaptcha</a>&nbsp;keys.</li></ul>



<p>After you create the form 2 new tabs will be shown in the form area Form Builder and Integration Code.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Form Builder</strong> – The place where you build the form and adjust all the fields you need.</li><li><strong>Integration Code</strong> is the code you will need to place into your website for the form to be shown, note that from the link you will be able to see that each has a unique key.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Add fields to form</h2>



<p>To add a field to the form just&nbsp;<strong>drag the field to the right side in the form area</strong>, note that <strong>the Email field is required to exist in the form as well must be marked as a required field.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Customize the fields</strong></h2>



<p>You can customize the labels, add help text, placeholders and make them required. When you drag the field in the form area just hover over the field on the top right side you will be able to see 3 buttons (edit, copy and remove)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="417" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field-1024x417.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4263" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field-1024x417.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field-300x122.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field-768x313.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field-60x24.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field-150x61.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/estimate-request-form-field.png 1203w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After you customized the form <strong>click on the bottom left button SAVE and click on the tab Integration Code to get the code you need to add to your website</strong>. The code will be placed as iframe and you can adjust the width and height directly to the code snippet provided by Perfex CRM.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Styling</h2>



<p>If you need to style the color of the input fields to fit with your website you can create<strong> custom.css</strong> file in assets/css and apply the necessary styles.</p>



<p>Example<strong> changing inputs border color:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>body.estimate-request-form input {
   border-color:red;
}</code></pre>



<p>Example <strong>changing submit button</strong>&nbsp;<strong>background color:</strong></p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>body.estimate-request-form #form_submit {
   background:red;
}

body.estimate-request-form #form_submit:hover,
body.estimate-request-form #form_submit:active {
   background:green;
}</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Redirect user to custom URL after submission</h2>



<p>Via FTP/cPanel go to <b>application/helpers/</b> and create (if don&#8217;t exists) file <b>my_functions_helper.php</b> and add the following code snippet:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>hooks()-&gt;add_action('estimate_request_form_submitted','my_estimate_request_form_submitted_redirect_to_custom_url');

function my_estimate_request_form_submitted_redirect_to_custom_url($data){
    echo json_encode(array(
      'success'=&gt;true,
      'redirect_url'=&gt;'http://yourcustomurl.com'
    ));
    die;
}</code></pre>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to include the &lt;?</strong>php<strong> opening tag at the top of the file if it&#8217;s not already added.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Include logo in the form</h2>



<p>To include your company logo in the form, you can either share or embed the url with query string parameter as shown below:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https:&#47;&#47;your-perfexcrm-installation.com/form-url?with_logo=1</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Direct link sharing</h2>



<p>The forms can be shared directly to your customers without actually embedding the form on your website, this feature is useful for example if you want to include a link in emails, SMS etc&#8230;</p>



<p>In order Perfex CRM can know that the form link is shared directly and not embedded into an iframe, you need to specify the URL query string, in this case, Perfex CRM will provide better styling to the form.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https://your-perfexcrm-installation.com/form-url<strong>?with_logo=1&amp;styled=1</strong></code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create multi-column form layouts</h2>



<p>By default, the form fields will be added in a single column full width of the document if you want to customize the form and have the fields displayed in multiple columns we have added the ability to achieve this with custom classes applied to the field, <strong>you can add up to 12 columns in 1 row.</strong></p>



<p>In the following example, we will create 2 fields in 2 columns and 1 row.</p>



<p><strong>Keep in mind that the columns won&#8217;t be applied in the form builder, only when the form is viewed by accessing the integration link or is in an iframe.</strong></p>



<p>Here is a quick example:</p>



<p>Final result:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="288" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-1024x288.png" alt="web-to-lead-form-2-columns" class="wp-image-1956" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-1024x288.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-300x84.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-768x216.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-60x17.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-150x42.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns.png 1096w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Assume that in your form builder you have 4 fields, as in order Name, Email Address, Company, Address.</p>



<p>For the first 2 fields click on the EDIT button on the top right side of the field wrapper to slide down the edit area, in the class input add an additional class for both fields <strong>form-col-6</strong> as shown in the image below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-1024x666.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="666" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-1024x666.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1957" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-1024x666.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-300x195.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-768x500.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-60x39.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit-150x98.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-2-columns-edit.png 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Save the form by clicking on the save button and preview the form from the integration link to see the final result.</p>



<p>As mentioned before you can add up to 12 columns, in this case, form-col-6 + form-col-6 = 12, in case you want to add 3 columns apply the class <strong>form-col-4</strong> on 3 fields (form-col-4*3 fields will be 12 and the fields will fit the document) that are <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/web-to-lead-form-3-columns.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one by one in order.</a></p>



<div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">Because in most cases you will embed the form into a small container/portion of your website, the bootstrap grid CSS will still show the columns new rows (not split in 2 columns), in this case, consider adding another additional class for small containers, for example if you added <strong>form-col-6</strong> class, <strong>add additional class for small area</strong> <strong>form-col-xs-6, </strong>click <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/form-col-xs-6-web-to-lead-form.png">here</a> to check how this should look</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong id="consider">Few things to consider</strong></h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>When placing the iframe snippet code there are few things you need to consider.</strong> <ol><li>If the protocol of your Perfex CRM installation is HTTP then use an HTTP page inside the iframe.</li><li>If the protocol of your Perfex CRM installation is https than use an https page inside the iframe.</li><li>Summarized will be <strong>no SSL Perfex CRM installation will need to place the link in no SSL</strong> eq landing page and backward, SSL websites with SSL Perfex CRM&nbsp;installation and no SSL website with none SSL Perfex CRM installation.

<p>You can check all available email template mentioned above in <strong>Setup-&gt;Email Templates</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Checking if the email is opened</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to configure anything, the feature is auto turned ON and will work out of the box while you use Perfex CRM.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume you sent an invoice to a contact and you want to see if the contact opened the email, in admin area open the invoice preview area and click on the envelope menu icon, there will be a list of all tracked emails sent with indicator does they are opened or not.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3604" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking.png" alt="" width="971" height="357" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking.png 971w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-300x110.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-768x282.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-60x22.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-sent-emails-tracking-150x55.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" /></p>
<p>Use same steps to see if the email is opened is applied for all other features.</p>
<h3>Tracked emails not updated</h3>
<p>There is one occasion when this feature may not work properly, depends on the settings the contact/user configure in his email client. There is nothing Perfex CRM can do about this, the tracked email status will remain as <b>&#8220;<strong>Not Opened</strong>&#8220;</b></p>
<p>If the contact/user have an option in his email client/email interface to <strong>turn off remote content for the received emails, this may not work properly</strong>. Below you can find an example how this may look eq in <strong>Thunderbird</strong> email client</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3605" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-1024x80.png" alt="" width="980" height="77" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-1024x80.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-300x24.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-768x60.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-60x5.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy-150x12.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/emails-tracking-privacy.png 1311w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>In this case, if contact just read the email and don&#8217;t turn on remote content or don&#8217;t allow remote content for this specific email, the email will remain as &#8220;<strong>Not Opened</strong>&#8221;</p>

Subscription payments is provided via Stripe, you will need to have active Stripe account in order to use this feature.</p>



<p>Please note that the <strong>subscriptions feature is different from <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/recurring-invoice/">recurring invoices</a>.</strong> The recurring invoices are used only to re-create the invoice on a specific date but with subscriptions, if the customer is subscribed to the subscription, he/she will be auto-billed via Stripe and the invoice will be created.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Canceling Subscription</h3>



<p>To get familiar with canceling the subscription, please read more the official Stripe documentation by clicking <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/canceling-pausing#canceling">here</a></p>



<p><strong>Canceling from the admin area</strong></p>



<p>If you want to cancel subscription directly from the admin area, you can open the subscription and click on the cancel button, you will be able to see 2 options:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Cancel</li><li>Cancel at the end of the billing period</li></ul>



<p>If you click <strong>Cancel</strong>, the subscription <strong>will be canceled immediately</strong>, if you click <strong>Cancel at the end of billing period</strong>, the subscription will be canceled based on the end billing period and also, in this case, you can reactive the subscription, but if you cancel it immediately, there is no option to reactivate.</p>



<p><strong>Cancelling from customers area.</strong></p>



<p>The primary contact also can cancel the subscription via the customers area, the options are identical like in the admin area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Credit Card Token</h3>



<p>Perfex CRM will store the Stripe customer id in the database for future payments.</p>



<p>Credit card token is token provided by Stripe related to the credit card that subscribed to the subscription, <strong>Perfex CRM does not store the credit card number in the database</strong>, the credit card token and last 4 digits are fetched directly from Stripe servers via API.</p>



<p>The primary contact can update the credit card anytime he/she want by logging into the customers area and navigating from the top <strong>Profile menu -&gt; Credit Card.</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes your customers need to change the card info that they have on record with your business, whether that’s just to swap in a preferred card, or because the card issuer sent a replacement. Stripe takes care of&nbsp;updating expiring cards&nbsp;for you, and also attempts to update saved card details when a&nbsp;customer’s physical card is replaced, but in rare cases,<strong> if Stripe is unable to update the card details automatically, the contact must update the credit card manually via the customers area.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="356" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-1024x356.png" alt="Perfex CRM Update Stripe Card Token" class="wp-image-3570" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-1024x356.png 1024w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-300x104.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-768x267.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-60x21.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token-150x52.png 150w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/perfex-crm-stripe-update-card-token.png 1209w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Reusing the credit card token</strong></p>



<p><strong>The credit card token for this customer will be used or future subscription too</strong>, as example once the customer subscribe to the subscription, in Stripe, Perfex CRM will create customer and this credit card token will be linked to this customer, also the customer id from Stripe will be stored in Perfex CRM database for future payments.</p>



<p><strong>The next time you create a subscription for this customer, the customer won&#8217;t need to enter his credit card details again, he/she can just click a button and will be subscribed in no time.</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing Subscriptions</h3>



<p>If you want to test the subscriptions, you need to <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/stripe/">configure</a> Stripe testing keys and read the following guide:<a href="https://stripe.com/docs/testing"> https://stripe.com/docs/testing</a></p>



<p>In this guide, you can get familiar with how the testing works and also there is a list of test credit cards.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>before switching to production mode</strong>, while testing, if you subscribed to any test subscription, <strong>make sure to delete those subscriptions from</strong> Perfex CRM admin area.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="webhook">Configure Stripe checkout webhook for subscriptions (applicable for Perfex CRM versions below 2.4.0)</h3>



<p>While you are in Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;Payment Gateways-&gt;Stripe Checkout, <strong>you will need to configure the webhook for Stripe Subscriptions.</strong></p>



<p>Each installation will have unique webhook protection key, you will able to see yours in the&nbsp;<strong>Stripe Checkout Webhook Key </strong>field</p>



<p>In Stripe Dashboard navigate to <strong>Developers-&gt;Web hooks</strong>&nbsp;and click add a new endpoint.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="469" height="386" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3567" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point.png 469w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point-300x247.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point-60x49.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-web-hook-end-point-150x123.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" /></figure>



<p>The webhook URL will be like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
http://your-crm-installation.com/gateways/stripe/webhook/[WEBHOOK_KEY]
</div></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="777" height="135" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3566" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key.png 777w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-300x52.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-768x133.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-60x10.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-checkout-webhook-key-150x26.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px" /></figure>



<p>Replace<strong>&nbsp;[WEBHOOK_KEY]</strong> with your actual webhook key.</p>



<p>Perfex CRM will generate a unique key for each installation, you can either use this key or manually add any key in <strong>alphanumeric</strong> you want,<strong> in case you decide to change the webhook key and you already have configured the webhook in Stripe, you will need to update the webhook key in Stripe dashboard too.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Test your webhook</strong></p>


<div class="st-alert st-alert- "><strong>It&#8217;s very important to make sure that your webhook is configured properly</strong>, otherwise, the subscription feature may not work properly.</div>



<p>Once you configure the webhook via Stripe dashboard, click on the configured webhook URL and click on the top right button <strong>Send test webhook </strong>then a popup modal will be shown, just click on the bottom right button Send test webhook</p>



<p>Keep in mind that the &#8220;<strong>Send test webhook&#8221; button is only available when you have toggled to view test data</strong>, once you test the webhook URL while test data is toggled on, switch off test data and <strong>configure the same webhook URL in your live account.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="935" height="429" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-test-webhook.png" alt="Test Webhook in Stripe" class="wp-image-3601" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-test-webhook.png 935w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-test-webhook-300x138.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-test-webhook-768x352.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-test-webhook-60x28.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stripe-test-webhook-150x69.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px" /></figure>



<p>If the webhook is configured properly at the bottom you should see this response:</p>

<h4><strong>Items Rates Based On Currency Usage (v.1.9.2)</strong></h4>
<p>In previous versions, the item had a field for a rate which you was using as general rate eq for your base <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/currencies/">currency</a>, but the problem was that in case customer has different currency than the base currency the rate won’t be accurate when selecting the item from the drop-down when creating invoice/estimate/proposal.</p>
<p>Perfex CRM can bill in your base currency or in the customer currency if configured in the customer profile.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that your base currency is USD and you have a customer which is using EUR currency when you created the item you has added the rate as in your base currency  (USD).</p>
<p>When you navigate to Sales-&gt;Items and try to create/edit item you will be able to see that new field for rate in EUR will be shown, in this case when you create invoice/estimate/proposal and select a customer that is using EUR currency and then select an item the EUR rate will be auto-populated in the preview area for the item before you add it to the table. This will help you to add the item&#8217;s rate only once and then re-use it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2018 aligncenter" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency.png" alt="" width="648" height="757" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency.png 648w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency-257x300.png 257w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency-51x60.png 51w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/item-rate-in-different-currency-128x150.png 128w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind that the rate for other currency will be shown only if customers have configured to use another currency than the base currency.</strong></p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/add-items-products/">Add Items/Products</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<p>After sending the estimate to the customer if you want to send again the estimate there will be another email content. Becuase the initial estimate is already sent. Now the customer  maybe want the estimate again and in all cases this content will be different. Go to <b>Setup-&gt; Email Templates -&gt; Estimate Already Send to Client</b> to edit the email content when sending the estimate to your customer for second time.</p>
<p><div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">By default <strong>all contacts with permission estimate will be selected</strong> you can adjust to your needs.</div></p>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/send-estimate-to-email/">Send Estimate to Email</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merging invoices is feature in Perfex CRM that allows you to merge/include already created invoices into 1 invoice by passing all the invoice info to new invoice. This feature is used if your customer have other unpaid invoices but you need to create another invoice for the customer and you want to prevent your customer to pay multiple invoices, in this case your customer will only need to pay 1 invoice.</p>
<h4>How to check if there is available invoices to be merged?</h4>
<p>Available invoices to merge are showing in different places.</p>
<ol>
<li>When create new invoice &#8211; Available invoices to merge are shown after selecting customer, the system will check if there is available invoices to be merged into the invoice you are creating for the selected customer.</li>
<li>When you preview existing invoice from admin area &#8211; Available invoices will be shown on top and you can click on the edit button to apply the necessary action.</li>
<li>When you edit existing invoice &#8211; Available invoices for merging are shown imidiately after entering the edit invoice area.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><div class="st-alert st-alert- ">You can merge invoices only that belongs to the following</strong> <strong>statuses</strong>: Unpaid, Overdue, Draft.</div></p>
<p>Eq. If the invoice you edit is with status Partialy Paid you wont be able to merge exisiting invoices in this invoice with status Partialy Paid.</p>
<h4>How to merge the invoices?</h4>
<p>When you create/edit invoice on the top a message will be shown if there is invoices available for merging.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476.png" alt="merge invoice" width="768" height="476" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476-300x186.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476-60x37.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476-150x93.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p><strong>You can merge multiple invoices by clicking on the checkbox on the left side from the invoice number.</strong></p>
<p>After the field is checked the <strong>invoice items will be auto added in your existing invoice</strong> that you are currently creating or edit.</p>
<p>Additionaly you can mark the merged invoices as cancelled instead of deleting because merging invoices will create gaps in invoice numbers. Please do not merge invoices if you want no gaps in your invoice history. You also have the option of manually adjusting invoice numbers if you want to fill the gaps.</p>
<p><div class="st-alert st-alert-danger ">Cancelled invoices are excluded from the reports and overdue reminders are disabled.</div></p>
