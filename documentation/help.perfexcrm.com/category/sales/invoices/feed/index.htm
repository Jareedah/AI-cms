										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merging invoices is feature in Perfex CRM that allows you to merge/include already created invoices into 1 invoice by passing all the invoice info to new invoice. This feature is used if your customer have other unpaid invoices but you need to create another invoice for the customer and you want to prevent your customer to pay multiple invoices, in this case your customer will only need to pay 1 invoice.</p>
<h4>How to check if there is available invoices to be merged?</h4>
<p>Available invoices to merge are showing in different places.</p>
<ol>
<li>When create new invoice &#8211; Available invoices to merge are shown after selecting customer, the system will check if there is available invoices to be merged into the invoice you are creating for the selected customer.</li>
<li>When you preview existing invoice from admin area &#8211; Available invoices will be shown on top and you can click on the edit button to apply the necessary action.</li>
<li>When you edit existing invoice &#8211; Available invoices for merging are shown imidiately after entering the edit invoice area.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><div class="st-alert st-alert- ">You can merge invoices only that belongs to the following</strong> <strong>statuses</strong>: Unpaid, Overdue, Draft.</div></p>
<p>Eq. If the invoice you edit is with status Partialy Paid you wont be able to merge exisiting invoices in this invoice with status Partialy Paid.</p>
<h4>How to merge the invoices?</h4>
<p>When you create/edit invoice on the top a message will be shown if there is invoices available for merging.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-904" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476.png" alt="merge invoice" width="768" height="476" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476-300x186.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476-60x37.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/merge-invoices-768x476-150x93.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p><strong>You can merge multiple invoices by clicking on the checkbox on the left side from the invoice number.</strong></p>
<p>After the field is checked the <strong>invoice items will be auto added in your existing invoice</strong> that you are currently creating or edit.</p>
<p>Additionaly you can mark the merged invoices as cancelled instead of deleting because merging invoices will create gaps in invoice numbers. Please do not merge invoices if you want no gaps in your invoice history. You also have the option of manually adjusting invoice numbers if you want to fill the gaps.</p>
<div class="st-alert st-alert-danger ">Cancelled invoices are excluded from the reports and overdue reminders are disabled.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Settings</strong></h4>



<p>Navigate to <strong>Settings Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Cron Job</strong></p>



<p><b>Create a new invoice from the main recurring invoice only if the main invoice is with status paid?</b></p>



<p>If this field is set to No the recurring invoice is not with status paid the new invoice won&#8217;t be created</p>



<p><strong>Hour of day to perform automatic operations (24 hours format eq. 9 for 9am or 15 for 3pm.)</strong></p>



<p>The invoice will be re-created at a specific time of the day, based on the hour you have configured in this option.</p>



<p>Example if the invoice should be re-created at 1st of May if you set here 09 the invoice will be re-created 1st of May 9 AM.</p>



<p><b>Action to take after invoice is re-created</b></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Generate and Autosend the renewed invoice to the customer &#8211; <strong>NOTE:</strong> The customer contacts must configured <strong>email notification for invoices</strong> in order to receive the email.</li><li>Generate a Unpaid Invoice</li><li>Generate a Draft Invoice</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create&nbsp;recurring invoice</strong></h4>



<p>When you add/edit invoice you have an option to set this invoice to be recurring.</p>



<p>That&nbsp;means that the invoice will be re-created&nbsp;automatically based on your setup for recurring invoice (every X months). You can set recurring starting from 1 month to 12 months or select custom to fit your needs.</p>



<p><strong>How are the recurring days calculated?</strong></p>



<p>The date when the invoice needs to be re-created(renewed) is calculated from the <strong>invoice date.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The dates in the examples are shown in Y-m-d format.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Invoice date is XXXX-08-17</li><li>Recurring is <strong>every 1 month</strong></li><li>The invoice will be re-created (renewed) on XXXX-09-17</li></ul>



<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Invoice date is XXXX-03-01</li><li>Recurring is <strong>every month</strong></li><li>The invoice will be re-created (renewed) on XXXX-04-01</li></ul>

<p>When the invoices from this invoice will be generated you will have an overview which invoices are generated from this invoice at the <strong>Child Invoices</strong> tab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="987" height="351" src="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/recurring-child-invoices-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2533" srcset="https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/recurring-child-invoices-1.png 987w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/recurring-child-invoices-1-300x107.png 300w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/recurring-child-invoices-1-768x273.png 768w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/recurring-child-invoices-1-60x21.png 60w, https://help.perfexcrm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/recurring-child-invoices-1-150x53.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stop a Recurring Invoice</strong></h4>



<p>In order to stop recurring invoice, you will need to go to the invoice edit area and set the <strong>Recurring Invoice</strong> drop-down field to NO.</p>



<p><strong>NOTES</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>You need to have<a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/setup-cpanel-cron-job/"> setup cron job</a> for this feature.</li><li>Recurring Draft invoices <strong>won&#8217;t be re-created.</strong></li><li>Recurring invoices with status <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cancelled</span> (canceled invoices) <strong>will be</strong> still re-created when the date for the next recurring invoice comes.
