<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The right to data portability</h3>



<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-data-portability/">Learn more</a> about right to data portability</p>



<p>In <strong>Setup-&gt;GDPR-&gt;The right to data portability</strong> you can choose various options to be exported when contact or lead use the export feature. Perfex CRM will export the data in human readable JSON format.</p>



<p>Contacts can export data via the customers area and leads can export data via the public form, note that <strong>no</strong> attachments will be included in the export.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The right to restrict processing</h3>



<p>Click <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-restrict-processing/">here</a> to learn more about the right to restrict processing</p>



<p>There is no specific option for this right in Perfex CRM, but Perfex CRM already compatible with this right and this can be achieved in various ways.</p>



<p>In Perfex CRM you can do the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Set the customer/contact to inactive so you can have an indicator that this customer has restricted data processing, also when a customer is set to inactive eq staff member can&#8217;t create invoice under this customer.</li><li>Create custom field select eq with a name: Data processing restricted with 2 option Yes and No, this will help you to know that this customer/contact data is restricted for processing.</li><li>Disable all email notification for the contact, navigate to the customer contacts tab and open the contact, at the bottom you will be able to disable the email notifications.</li></ul>



<p>Inform your staff members the steps you performed to restrict the data and how they can know if the data is restricted to processing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Consent</h3>



<p>Click <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/consent/">here</a> to learn more about consent</p>



<p>If you are collecting the consent for marketing purposes, you will need to get consent from the user from a separate opt-in form, the consent <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> be included in terms and conditions policy.</p>



<p>The consent forms that Perfex CRM offers, will give simple and easy way to the users to give and withdraw consent at the same time without the need to contact you, very important part from GDPR concept for consent is that the consent checkboxes <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> be pre-checked which Perfex CRM comply with this.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that you cannot mix multiple consents in one, you must separate them and the user must give consent for all of them separately.</p>



<p>In the <strong>Consent</strong> tab, you can add an unlimited number of <strong>consent purposes</strong>.</p>



<p>Perfex CRM will store information about when the consent is given, IP address and the consent purpose, also if consent is manually added from the admin area, the staff name will be stored and the staff will be able to add additional information how the consent is given from the contact.</p>



<p><strong>Consent URL</strong></p>



<p>Each contact and each lead will have unique consent URL, where they can give you consent or withdraw the consent anytime they want.</p>



<p><strong>For contacts</strong>, the consent public URL is located in the customer profile under the contacts tab, for each contact you can click on the View Consent URL.</p>



<p><strong>For leads</strong>, the consent public URL is located in the lead modal under the GDPR tab.</p>



<p>After consent is enabled you will be able to <strong>include the consent url&nbsp;for leads and contacts in email templates</strong>, a new merge field will be available in Setup-&gt;Email Templates.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Custom Fields GDPR compliance</h3>



<p>Custom fields in Perfex CRM give you the ability to create your own personalized fields for your own purpose to store and collect more data, as GDPR comes in into force, <strong>you may want to re-think how you will use the custom fields data you store and how you will manage the custom fields in Perfex CRM.</strong></p>



<p>Our recommendation is to add only custom fields you really need and make them visible to customers area too, so in this case, contacts will be able to see the data you store about them and also update the data.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that when you contact will export data, <strong>only custom fields that are checked to be visible on customers area</strong> will be included in the JSON format, as for leads in Setup-&gt;GDPR-&gt;The right of access/right to rectification you may want to&nbsp;Show lead custom fields in public form and also enable custom fields to be exported in Right to data portability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Use 2-factor Email Authentication For Admin Area</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/version-1-9-0/">version 1.9.0</a> we have added 2-factor authentication for staff members in order to increase the security while logging in to the admin area. Each staff member created in the system can have enabled 2-factor authentication.</p>
<p><strong>The 2-factor authentication is provided via email</strong>, which means after staff enters his login credentials correctly <strong>the system will send unique authentication key via email</strong> in order the staff to log in successfully will need to enter the authentication key.</p>
<p>Staff members can enable 2-factor authentication by clicking on the top menu dropdown then <strong>Edit Profile</strong> link, meanwhile admins or staff with permissions for staff EDIT will be able to change this option for each staff member in <strong>Setup-&gt;Staff</strong>.</p>
<p><strong id="disable_2factor_auth">Disable 2-factor authentication</strong></p>
<p>In case you got locked when 2-factor authentication is enabled and for some reason the system can&#8217;t send an email to provide you authentication code, you will need to disable 2-factor authentication via <strong>phpmyadmin</strong>.</p>
<p>Login to PHPMyAdmin, select Perfex CRM database, find table tblstaff and update the <strong>two_factor_auth_enabled</strong> column to 0</p>
<h3>Enable CSRF Protection (from v1.9.4)</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you performed a clean install of version 2.0 or above, <strong>this option will be by default enabled</strong>, don&#8217;t add again the code if it&#8217;s already in the config file.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from version 1.9.4</strong> we have implemented additional security feature in Perfex CRM, this feature by default will be disabled ATM because it&#8217;s still in beta mode and customers can enable the feature manually by just adding a simple constant in the app-config.php file.</p>
<p>After we confirm that everything works fine with this feature enabled we will by default enable CSRF protection in Perfex CRM, in case you are experiencing some issues while this feature is enabled, don&#8217;t hesitate to open support ticket by clicking <a href="https://my.perfexcrm.com">here</a></p>
<p>In order to enable this feature via cPanel/Ftp navigate from your Perfex CRM installation to application/config/app-config.php and add the following code at the bottom of this file:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">/**
 * Enables CSRF Protection
 */
define('APP_CSRF_PROTECTION',true);</pre>
<h3>Enable Google reCaptcha</h3>
<p>To prevent spam bots brute forcing your login areas it&#8217;s recommended to enable Google reCaptcha feature for clients register, clients log in, and admin/staff login.</p>
<p>Click <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/add-google-recaptcha/">here </a>to see a detailed explanation how to configure Google reCaptcha</p>
<h3>Enable Honeypot Spam Validation (from v.2.9.4)</h3>
<p>If you are receiving spam registrations, we strongly recommend enabling Honeypot spam technique in Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;Customers</p>
<h3>Use Stronger Passwords</h3>
<p>Perfex CRM by default does not have any logic to detect if the passwords are strong enough but it&#8217;s recommended staff members to use/generate a stronger password.</p>
<p>When creating staff member or contact in the password field there is an generate icon which will generate for you strong enough password which will be harder spam bots to guess it.</p>
<h3><strong>Add Cron Job URL Key (from v1.9.4).</strong></h3>
<p>The cron  job URL which is different for each system based on the domain and installation folder/path is different for each Perfex CRM installation, however, this URL can be easily guessed because there is no keys protection or additional salts appended to the URL. In order to prevent direct access to this URL, it&#8217;s recommended to add cron job key.</p>
<p>Make sure you use a different salt key, in this example, we will use the following key: <strong>ty543dtry634as5</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that your current cron job is <strong>http://yourdomain.com/crm/cron/index</strong> after you define the key you cron job URL will be changed to http://yourdomain.com/crm/cron/index/<strong>ty543dtry634as5</strong></p>
<p>In order to enable this feature via cPanel/Ftp navigate from your Perfex CRM installation to application/config/app-config.php and add the following code at the bottom of this file:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">/**
 * Add Additional Cron Job URL Key
 */
define('APP_CRON_KEY','ty543dtry634as5');</pre>
<p><div class="st-alert st-alert- "> If your cron job is already properly <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/setup-cron-job/">configured </a>with the old URL, you will need to update your current cron job URL with the new one in order to work properly with the newly created key. Your new cron job URL can be found at Setup-&gt;Settings-&gt;Cron Job.</div></p>
<h3 id="spam_bots">Bad user agents blocker (from v2.0.0)</h3>
<p>From version 2.0.0 there are additional security features added in Perfex CRM that will help you to block known bad user agents, this feature will help you to fight with spam.</p>
<p>In order to enable this feature via cPanel/Ftp navigate from your Perfex CRM installation to application/config/app-config.php and add the following code at the bottom of this file:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">// Enables bad user agents block
define('APP_BAD_USER_AGENT_BLOCK', true);</pre>
<h3>Admin access only from specific IP address via .htaccess</h3>
<p>If you have a <strong>dynamic IP address, please ignore this</strong> because in all cases this won&#8217;t work properly and you will be blocked from admin area each time your ISP changes the IP address.</p>
<p>If you access Perfex CRM admin area only from your home/office IP address, you can block any other requests to admin area by IP address. Keep in mind that if you apply this, you or your staff members won&#8217;t be able to access the Perfex CRM admin area from other IP addresses eq their home, from mobile data etc&#8230;</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, in your Perfex CRM installation directory find the main <strong>.htaccess</strong> file and on the top add:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true "># My office IP address
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^xxx\.xxx\.xxx\.xxx
# You can add additional IP address eq. home IP
# RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^xxx\.xxx\.xxx\.xxx
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /admin [NC]
RewriteRule ^ - [F]</pre>
<p>Replace the <strong>xxx</strong> with the actual IP address you want to allow access from.</p>
<p><strong>In case you are blocked, just remove the code you added in the .htaccess file.</strong></p>
<h3>Disable Customers Area</h3>
<p>Some customers don&#8217;t use the customers area at all, <strong>in case you are one of the users that don&#8217;t use the customers area</strong> and use Perfex CRM only for internal usage you can disable access to customers area.</p>
<p>Click <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/disabling-customers-area/">here </a>to read more how to disable customers area.</p>
<h3>Use HTTPS Connection</h3>
<p>The admin and customers area can be more secure when using HTTPS connection.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you already have installed Perfex CRM on HTTP connection click <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/switch-to-https-after-installing-to-http/">here </a>to read how to change to HTTPS</li>
<li>When performing fresh install you only need to make sure to enter the <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/faq/what-is-base-url/">Base URL</a> in the last step to start with HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Before using HTTPS connections make sure that you have valid SSL certificate installed on your server.</p>

<li>If all server requirements passed click <strong>Go to Files/Folders Permissions</strong> otherwise consult with your hosting provider to fix/enable them.</li>



<li>If all permissions are passed click <strong>Setup Database </strong>otherwise you need to set 755 permissions for folders and 644 for files.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Create New Language</h4>



<p>In Perfex CRM you can easily&nbsp;change the&nbsp;language. You only need to translate all the strings based on your needs.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Navigate to <strong>application/language</strong> and <strong>copy</strong> the default <strong>english</strong> folder.</li><li><strong>Rename </strong>the folder in the language you want to translate. eq. <b>french</b></li></ol>



<p><strong><b>You must</b> rename the files inside the folder</strong> you copied based on the main folder name eq. we renamed our new folder to <b>french</b> and in this folder, there are 2 files, <strong>english_lang.php</strong> and <strong>english_num_words_lang.php</strong> that should be renamed like this: <span class="file_name"><strong>french_lang.php</strong></span> and <strong>french_num_words_lang.php</strong></p>



<p>Translate all the strings via your favorite code editor and navigate to <strong>Setup -> Settings -> Localization</strong> you will see that your language is available in the dropdown to select it and save changes.</p>



<p>If the language you are trying to translate already exists in Perfex CRM files that come with the package its recommended to rename the folder/files eq. my_french and my_french_lang.php</p>


<div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">If you are<strong> using language that don’t exist</strong> in Perfex CRM make sure after each update to copy all the new text after # Version X.X.X from the original English file located in application/language/english/english_lang.php</div>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Overwriting translation texts</h4>



<p>Read more <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/overwrite-translation-text/">here </a>to see how to overwrite translation texts to make Perfex CRM fit for your needs.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="Encoding" class="mw-headline">Encoding</span></h4>



<p>Language files in Perfex CRM use the UTF-8 encoding without a Byte Order Marker, when creating language override files it is important to maintain the same encoding.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Github</h4>



<p>All the language files are available on Github, if you wan&#8217;t to contribute translation you can create pull request and we will review the language and approve the pull request. Click <a href="https://github.com/mstojanovv/PerfexCRM">here </a>to check the github repository.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Special Charachters</h4>


<div class="st-alert st-alert-danger ">If you want to use the &#8216; character in your translation text you have to replace it with \&#8217;<br />
</div>



<p>Eq:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted lang:default decode:true">$lang['language_text_key'] = 'Text with \'quotes';</pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="st-alert st-alert- ">Always backup your files and database before doing anything.</div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enable debug mode</h3>



<p>Before copying/moving the files, in your existing installation, enable <strong>debug mode</strong> in the main <strong>index.php</strong> file as explained <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/faq/how-to-set-debug-mode/">here</a>.</p>



<p>This will help to see the errors in case you are having problems or receiving <strong>500 errors</strong> after the migration, the error messages that will help you easily to resolve the issue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Copy/Move files and database</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Copy </strong>Perfex files to a new location or if you are moving to another server you can use cPanel to compress the file to .zip then upload and extract the zip file in your new server.</li><li><strong>Export Perfex database</strong> (from <strong>phpmyadmin</strong>, see instructions below)</li><li>In new location, go to <strong>application/config/app-config.php</strong></li><li>In <strong>app-config.php</strong>, change base URL to new URL and <strong>make sure database name, user and password are correct for the new location.</strong></li><li><strong>Import the database</strong> (.sql) file from phpmyadmin into your new server.</li></ol>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Migrate old links</h2>


<div class="st-alert st-alert-info ">Follow the steps mentioned below only if you are migrating to another domain, the following steps are to replace any old URL used in the database with the new URL.</div>



<p>After you finish the first steps go to <strong>application/config/migration.php</strong> and</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$config&#091;'migration_enabled'] = false;</code></pre>



<p>To</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$config&#091;'migration_enabled'] = true;</code></pre>



<p>After you enable the migration you need to replace any links contained in the CRM with your old base URL.</p>



<p>Go to <strong>http://yournewbaseurl.com/migration/make?old_base_url=http://myoldbaseurl.com/</strong></p>



<p>Replace <strong>http://myoldbaseurl.com/</strong> with your old base URL where Perfex CRM was installed. <strong>(the same as it was in application/app-config.php)</strong></p>



<p>Total links replaced will be shown after success check. If is a new installation and doesn&#8217;t have a lot of data don&#8217;t get confused if the total replaced links show zero.</p>



<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget to turn back migration_enabled to false</strong></p>



<p>That is all that needs to be done. If files were copied correctly, the database was imported correctly and files were modified/checked correctly, Perfex will now function on the new URL.</p>
