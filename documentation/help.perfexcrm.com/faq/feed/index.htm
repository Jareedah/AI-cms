										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are developing custom features for Perfex CRM or you are experiencing internal server error, you can turn debug mode to see any error messages.</p>
<p>To turn debug/development mode navigate to the directory where Perfex CRM is installed and find <strong>index.php</strong>.</p>
<p>Open the file and find:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">define('ENVIRONMENT', 'production');</pre>
<p>Change this to:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">define('ENVIRONMENT', 'development');</pre>
<p>In case there are errors thrown that can be visible on screen, you will be able to see the errors now, additionally, the errors will be logged in <strong>application/logs</strong>, you may want to check this directory too.</p>
<p>Be aware that in development mode <b>you may see some errors and deprecation warnings</b>, for this reason, it&#8217;s always recommended to set the environment to &#8220;<b>production</b>&#8221; if you are not actually developing some features/modules or trying to test some code.</p>
<div class="st-alert st-alert- ">Do not forget to turn it back when you finish with debugging.</div>The post <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com/faq/how-to-set-debug-mode/">How to Set Development/Debug Mode?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://help.perfexcrm.com">Perfex CRM</a>.]]></content:encoded>
